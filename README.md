# jsoneng-api
Jsoneng API service, powered by jsoneng javascript edition, for use in community open source projects

This is a wrapper around the jsoneng local json database engine npm package

By using API calls, you can invoke jsoneng to create json database files without having to install jsoneng directly in your projects in any of your web applications such as React projects without having to tweak with cross origins policy of your browser or Node, adding a layer of safety and scalability
